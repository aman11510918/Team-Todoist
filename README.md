# Todoist clone

We have created a clone of todoist.com, wherein a user can manage his tasks very easily. Our app lets users keep track of everything in one place, so you can get it all done and enjoy more peace of mind along the way.

## Available Scripts

### Things to do before testing

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. This should be done as soon as you clone our repository.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br> 
The app can now be pushed to Heroku server if everything works fine<br>

### `npm run serve`

Runs the app in development. This command should be run after successfully running `npm run build`.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
